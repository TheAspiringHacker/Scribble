        Emelle is a work-in-progress visual
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)'>ML</a>
        dialect. It is inspired by
        <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu'>Scratch</a>'s editing style, but aims
        to have better abstractions to teach students better programming
        practices and provide a higher ceiling for more expressive programs.
